Non-Functional Testing:-->

=> Tester involve in non-functional testing using NFRS document
	[Non functional required specification document].

=> After completed functional testing  testing team involve in non functional
	testings.


1.Usability Testing:-->
	During this test tester verify user friendlyness of software

	Note:--> Tester verify software userfriendlyness using below checklist

	1.Verify spelling in all screens of software
	2.Verify labels in it all screens of software
	3.Verify Meaning of labels in all screens of software
	4.Verify line spacing in label and control
	5.Verify line spacing in controls
	6.Verify location of controls which are functionality related
	7.Verify home button in every screens
	8.Verify shortcuts in labels of screens
	9.Verify icon symbol meaning
	10.Verify icon tool tips
	11.Verify  keyboard access on every screens
	12.Verify meaning of error
	13.Verify system menu existence in screens.(Minimize, Maximize, Restore, click….etc
	14.Verify help documentations.
	15.Verify color contrast of screens

===============================================================================
2. Compatibily Testing:-->
	During this test tester verify browser and operating system comptibility.
	Here test engineer verify whether software is accessable and operatable 
	with in client expected browsers and operating systems.

	=> Other name of compatibility testing is cross browser testing
		[In real time organizations use selenium kind of automation tools to 
			conduct cross -browser automation]	

	Difficulties:-->
		=> if developer fix bug in one browser it effect to other browsers. Because
			each browser follow differnt domain polocies
	
		=> manually testing in differnet browsers it is time  taking process.

================================================================================
3.Performance testing
	=> Performance is non functional testing 
	=> Performance testing not conduct at user interface
	=> Performance testing only possible using automation tool like [LoadRunner, Jmeter]
	=> During this test performance testing engineers verify software speed  and response
		under customer expected configuration
		

	Performance testing can be conducted using below sub tests..
			1. Load Testing
			2. Stress Testing
			3. Spike Testing
			4. Endurance Testing

Loadtesting: 
	the execution of software under customer configaration and cutomer
	expected load(No of concurrent users) to estimate speed in processing, is called
	load testing

Stress testing:
	the execution of software under customer expected configaration and more 
	than customer expected load to estimate "peak load" is called stress testing

spike testing:
	the execution of software under cutomer configaration and more than
	customer expected load to estimate relability.
	=>During this test tester add no of concurrent user suddenly and verify
	    speed in processing

Endurance testing:
	execution of software under cutomer configaration and more than
	customer expected load continously to estimate logvity and durability is called
	endurance testing
=========================================================================
Datavolume testing:
	During this test, testing team is operating software by storing sample 
	data to estimate capacity of the software database.

	Depends on technology, database capacities are changing due to this
	reason testing team conduct data volume testing to find the capacity of database
	in number of records.
========================================================================
Intersystem testing:-->
	During this test, testing team verify our software is sharing data and co-existing
	with other softwares.

		Example:--> Flipkart use different payment gateways to make payement.
				=> VISA
				=> Master
				=> American Express
=========================================================================
Installation Testing:-->
	=> Installation testing conduct most commonly on Desktop softwares
	=> To conduct installation testing tester follow below steps 

	1.Verify set up program execute to start installation
	2.Verify friendliness of screens while installation
	3.Verify occupied space after installation
	4.Verify Un install process 
	5.Verify user can cancel installation any time.
	6.Verify installation asking accept license agreement.
	7.Verify user able to watch installation screens.
=======================================================================
Recovery Testing:-->

	Recovery testing is performed in order to determine how quickly the system can
	recover after the system crash or hardware failure. 
	It comes under the type of nonfunctional testing.
==========================================================================
. Globalization Testing.
	Globalization is a process of designing a software application so that 
	it can be adapted to various languages and regions without any changes.

		Example:-->
			Amazon website can across the world with
			differnet price tags.
			
			India --> http://amazon.in
			UK    --> http://amazon.uk
			USA   --> http://amazon.com

===========================================================================
Localization Testing (L10N Testing):
	Localization is a process of adapting globalization software for a specific 
	region orlanguage by adding local specific components.

	1. Verify software available in local language
	2. Verify local timezones are displaying
	3. Verify Local maps displaying at software

	Multy languity testing:
	some times developers are developing a s\w in java unicode or .net with
	unicode. This type  of sofware provide output in differnt lanaguge and by
	taking input in one language.
==============================================================================
Security Testing:-->

	Finding vulnarable spots with in software. 
		It mean finding weak spots of software.

	In one word security testing means authorized user can get access 
	software, for unauthrized user prevent software access.


	1. Authorization
	2. Authentication
	3. Dataprotection
	4. SQL injection [Cross site scripting]
	5. Session Management
	6. ErrorHandling
	7. Access points
	8. Cookies 
	9. brute force attack

	
Authorization:-->
	According to roles and responsibilites user able to access software.
	Also prevent invalid user to access software features.

	During this test testing team login into software with different
 	roles and check authorities available according to there 
	roles and responsibilities..

		=> What role is yours ?


	Example:-->
	In online video conference meeting only organizer have
	permission to record meeting. This access should be restricted 
	to attendies..

Authentication:-->
		=> Who you are?
		=> authorized access  is granted to protect data and 
		unauthorized access is restricted

		Example:-->
		Login authentication:-->
		 Only valid user can access software and features of it.
		for invalid user system restrict access ask to register 
		with software.

		Example:-->
		  Only with valid OTP we can access software features

dataprotection:-->
	=> Also we can call as encryption and decryption testing
	=> Dataprotection testing can be done over userinterface and database.
	=> In userinterface testing team verify all account passwords are 
			restricting user to watch/copy.

	How data protection tested in database:-->
	=> Testers send queries to read password of user and verify 
		data is saved in encrypted format.

SqlInjection:-->
	=> Other name of sql injection is corss site map  testing
	=> Testers verify site is accessing any malicious script inorder to  manipulate
	   software original behaviour..
	=> Mostly test conduct at input fields like [Editbox, Listbox ---etc]

	

	Example:-->
	=> Bank employees restricted to transfter ammount upto 200000.Then employee
	is trying to increase range by sending malicious script.

Testcases:-->
    1.	Verify invalid credentials that cannot be entered less than 6 characters 
			and password should not be the same.
    2.  Verify system should restrict accessing previous pages after Sign out.
    3.  Verify bookmarked pages asking to re enter authentication
    4.  Verify bookmark option disabled on secured pages
    5.  Verify system restricted user to view source
    6.  Verify Right click option is disabled
    7.  Verify your server lock out when individual who has tried to 
	Access a site multiple times with invalid user account.
    8.  Verify system ask user to login again after timeout finished
    9.  Verify preventing software access. when user try direct url entry 
	to access  secured pages.
    10. Verify the same account login at diff machines. [At a time only 
	one user login into system]
    11. Verify that error message doesn't contain malicious info so that 
	hacker can’t hack website.
    12. Verify input fields restrict html and xml tags injection.
    13. Verify data projected in database should display user passwords in 
	encrypted  format.
    14. Verify system restricted guessing passwords using hacking software
	[brute force attack]
    15. Verify software is  restricted to access from different portals when
         User have permission to access using single gateway.
    16. Verify cookies are auto delete on secure pages
    17. Verify cookies are allowed user to delete manually
===================================================================================
Compliance testing:-->

	Verify software is developed as per standards   
		[Six sigma, CMML].
